# caching4e: Caching for Education

The aim is to implement various caching strategies which are used in the backend.
Some of them are:

1. Cache Aside (Lazy Loading)
2. Read through caching
3. Write through caching
4. Write around
5. Refresh Ahead

More strategies may be added as I learn more and more.
